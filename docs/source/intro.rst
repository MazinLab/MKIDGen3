Introduction
============

The Gen3 MKID readout is the third generation room temperature electronics system capable of reading out thousands of MKID pixels in real time. The system consists of multiple feedline readout units each capable of reading out 2048 MKID in 4-8 GHz.

Motivation
**********
The Gen3 MKID readout leverages RF-integrated FPGAs (RFSoCs) to allow more MKIDs to be read out with less weight, volume, and power than the previous MKID readout system.
